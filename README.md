## About software
After many years in making, we are happy to introduce a free and open-sourced MatLab/GNU Octave package for EIS analysis called NELM, which provides powerful equipment tools for matching experimental impedance data 
with theoretical equivalent circuits. Our software has an user friendly interface and supports different formats of input data, fitting programs, and impedance models. 
In addition, we have developed NELM with implementation of the latest progress in computational science such as symbolic calculations, parallel computing, and artificial intelligence. 
## Installation
Before starting work with NELM, users need to make sure that their computer meets all necessary requirements. To operate, NELM software requires a preinstalled application package \textsc{MatLab} version not lower than 2015a or \textsc{GNU Octave} version no lower than 9.3.0. The NELM 1.0 beta distribution requires 37 MB of free disk space (2 MB without example data). To fully use NELM, it is desirable to have a multicore processor compatible with the Parallel ToolBox package, at least 1 GB of free RAM, and access to the Internet for cloud computing. 
After acquiring the starter pack, to make sure that the program was installed correctly, we recommend having a test run of the program with the data and settings provided for RLC circuit (use the premade Settings_RLC.m! and data in folder \Example_data\ascii\RLC 130 ohm 15 mH 10 nF\, see video lesson on Youtube).
## Tutorial
Written tutorial can be found in [Preprint](https://github.com/BioElectronicsLab/NELM-1.0-beta/tree/main/Article%20(Preprint)), video lessons are published at our [Youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_NmEvXt8mLM)
## Plans
Right now we are working on an update to NELM that will bring its users an opportunity to find the most fitting equivalent scheme for their data.
